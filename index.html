Brief Description of Goal of Code:
to learn how to apply a canvas to a website that allows buttons to create drawings inside the canvas.
This app will further my knowledge and understanding on the coding process. I learned how to code for a button that will draw a rectangle,
circle, my name, an image from the internet on the canvas I made. I also learned how to clear the canvas so you could start over.
 
Known Issues:
Having problems connecting my buttons to my functions. 
Had problems with the image code I was provided.
i now have no known problems.
